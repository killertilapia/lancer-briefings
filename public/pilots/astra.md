# Horus Cache

It was seemingly an accident of fate, Cache met with a Horus Balor machine. It took her inside and it took about an hour before she figured out how to get out. When she got out she was .... changed. 

She was still her but with cybernetics except of head, portion of her chest, belly and groin. The rest of her is fully composites and metallic. It was a weird feeling nothing different but she can clearly see she was different.

Clearly, Cache Strickland from Bethuel is no more.
