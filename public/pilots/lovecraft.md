Seiji was born into a large mixed-race family famous for making cheese in the Kingdom of Limberry. They in-fact, have a village named after the family just south of Limberry castle.

But Seiji wasn't interested in making cheese was but more interested in machines; playing with them, dismantling them, repairing them, customizing them. 

That interest allowed him enter the College of Limberry. A high institution of education that also produced Lancers. Tragically, it was also that interest in machines that caused an accident in the college that injured several students and staff causing a scandal. 

It force Seiji to go west hoping Limberry will soon forget the tragic incident. 

But that love of machines could not stop Seiji, so we took on the open enrollment at Dorter Academy and passed. He just conveniently omitted some facts about his past.
