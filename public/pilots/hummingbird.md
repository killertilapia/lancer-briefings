Paco Carvallo was 13 years old when his parents died in a tragic industrial accident. 

But as luck would have it, Sir Haywood Baxter, a former employer of Paco's father let him live with them and eventually gave him a  job at his trading house. 

The staff at the Baxter Trading Company notice that Paco was quite intelligent, hardworking and agile. They encourage him to try out for the annual open enrollment at Dorter Academy of Arms. He got in.
