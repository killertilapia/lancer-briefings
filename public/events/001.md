After 4 years of study, gene therapy, and training, surviving Lancer cadets are set to graduate. 
Like many storied institutions, the Dorter Academy of Arms, has many traditions. 

The most important of these traditions is the Dust Bowl. It is a rite of combat ever since Lancers 
started training at the academy. It showcases the skills of the graduating Lancer cadets and brings 
honor to the cadet's lord patron.

It is a festive event for the city of Dorter - food, drink and gambling. As much as the rite is part 
of the academy, it is also part of the identity of Dorter city. 

# DUST BOWL  // 9.18.5016u
It is called the Dust Bowl because these rites of combat are done in the academy's live fire training ground. 
The training ground is about a kilometer northwest of the academy is a natural depression which 
looks like a bowl. The ground of the bowl is a mix of beach sand and very fine dry dirt. 

The terrain layout is different for each Dust Bowl. There are blecher seats with sun shades around 
the edge of the depression for the fans.
