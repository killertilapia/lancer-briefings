# After Graduation  // 4.10.18.5016u
The squad have moved out of the Dorter Academy dorms and into
the Baxter Trading Company compound. They are added to the company's
security team.

Paco was nostalgic when he moved back into his old room.

# BXTC Land Crawler // 4.10.18.5016u
The squad gets to see the BXTC Land Crawler and meet the crew. They met with the caravan
leader Vahid Kamal who has worked for Baxter Trading for over 20 years.

Seiji inspects every corner of the land crawler. He was like a kid in a toy store.

# Route to Vitral
The squad is attached to the BXTC Land Crawler as it's security detail but they are part of a larger trade caravan called a Land Train. There are 2 other land crawlers joining the land train belonging to Mowbray Company and Lombardo Industries. 

There are 3 major stops and it will take about 2 weeks to get to Vitral. 

There are pirate, brigand and monster attacks reported on the route.
