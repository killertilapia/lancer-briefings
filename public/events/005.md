# City of Geth // 10.23.18.5016u

In a little over day, the BXTC Lancers have been Land Crawler security to now mercenaries for the crown. They decided that fighting for the City of Geth and get paid is the way to go.

# Cache is More

It was seemingly an accident of fate, Cache met with a Horus Balor machine. It took her inside and it took about an hour before she figured out how to get out. When she got out she was .... changed.

She was still her but with cybernetics except of head, portion of her chest, belly and groin. The rest of her is fully composites and metallic. It was a weird feeling nothing different but she can clearly see she was different.

Clearly, Cache Strickland from Bethuel is no more.

# Dafuq?!

"Cache! Are you ok?" Albus shouts at this glowing, shimmering machine. 

"I think I'm ok..." As Cache thinks she's moving her arm but see the Balor's arm moving.

Paco jumps on his new Raleigh ready of anything.

Seiji barely contained himself seeing the Balor machine. "Holy shit that's cool!" 

# On first light, look to the East

After getting their machines, the BXTC Lancers get ready to sortie out and break the blockade.

The City of Geth is being blockaded by a mechanized army that was made for mobility. It is led by Prince Lucian, Duke of Gallione. Spies report that the main body of this army is about 20 hours away. 

So if the Lancers want to break the blockade then it's now.

They face mostly mobile armor - tanks and fixed artillery - but luckily limited mechs. 

The chances for success is slightly favorable to the BXTC lancers unless the intelligence was grossly unaccurate.
